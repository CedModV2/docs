Installation guides to install exiled for NWAPI or Exiled/Exiled Reboot
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## What to choose?

The basic difference between **Exiled** and **NWAPI** is
that Exiled has an integrated permission system while NWAPI doesn't.
Meaning if you use Exiled for your permissions and everything you should stick with the CedMod versions for exiled.
If you already use NWAPIPermissionSystem you may want to consider using the NWAPI version of CedMod
