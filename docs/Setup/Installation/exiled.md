## How to install Exiled

Download the latest compatible release of either **Exiled** or **Exiled Reboot**.
It is not relevant
which of them you use but due note that they have to completely different development teams
and are aiming for different goals.

On a guide on how to install Exiled/Exiled Reboot on their official docs. 
For Exiled go [here](https://github.com/ExMod-Team/EXILED/blob/master/.github/documentation/README.md#installation), 
for Exiled Reboot look [here](https://github.com/Exiled-Team/EXILED?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
The guides are practically identical but could change in the future when development of the two changes more and more.

## Getting the CedMod release

After installing exiled, you need to download the CedMod release compatible with it.
All releases will have a section that marks the compatibility with the exiled and game version.

{: .attention }
Make sure the CedMod release you are downloading has **EXILED** and not **NWAPI** in its title as only the exiled versions are meant for the exiled installation

1. Go to the [cedmod releases tab](https://github.com/CedModV2/CedMod/releases) and download your desired version
2. Drag and drop it into your plugins folder
3. Reboot your server

Your CedMod installation is done. 

## After the Installation

After you install CedMod and restart your server, a message will be displayed in your console:
```
CedMod requires additional Setup, the plugin will not function and some features will not work if the plugin is not setup.
Please follow the setup guide on https://cedmod.nl/Servers/Create
```

Go to the page [displayed in the message](https://cedmod.nl/Servers/Create),
and then follow the [instance creation guide](https://docs.cedmod.nl/docs/Setup/Instance/create.html)

{: .note }
If you already have a CedMod instance, then go to the queryserver page in your panel and create a new queryserver or copy the setup command of an existing one
