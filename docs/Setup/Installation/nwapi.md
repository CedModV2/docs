# Installation for NWAPI

NWAPI is the preinstalled plugins api for SCP: Secret Laboratory servers and does not need any extra installation

## Getting the CedMod release

{: .note }
Installation with nwapi requires the [NWAPIPermissionSystem](https://github.com/CedModV2/NWAPIPermissionSystem) to function properly

{: .attention }
Make sure the CedMod release you are downloading has **NWAPI** and not **EXILED** in its title as only the nwapi versions are meant for the nwapi installation

1. Go to the [cedmod releases tab](https://github.com/CedModV2/CedMod/releases) and download your desired version
2. Drag and drop it into your plugins folder
3. Reboot your server

## After the Installation

After you install CedMod and restart your server, a message will be displayed in your console:
```
CedMod requires additional Setup, the plugin will not function and some features will not work if the plugin is not setup.
Please follow the setup guide on https://cedmod.nl/Servers/Create
```

Go to the page [displayed in the message](https://cedmod.nl/Servers/Create),
and then follow the [instance creation guide](https://docs.cedmod.nl/docs/Setup/Instance/create.html)

{: .note }
If you already have a CedMod instance, then go to the queryserver page in your panel and create a new queryserver or copy the setup command of an existing one
